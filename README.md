# Workout Log (starter)

This is a starter React + TypeScript + Vite project with Tailwind CSS configured. It contains a minimal skeleton for a Workout Log app (Dashboard + Workouts pages) and a simple localStorage-based data layer.

Quick start (Windows PowerShell):

```powershell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Push to GitHub (one-line)

Run the included helper script from the project root to initialize the repo, commit and push to the remote you provided. You will be prompted for credentials if needed.

```powershell
./scripts/push-to-github.ps1
```

What I scaffolded:

- Vite + React + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS configured
- Basic routes: Dashboard and Workouts
- LocalStorage helpers and sample seed data

Next steps I can take if you want:

- Implement full CRUD for workouts and exercises
- Add charts/analytics (volume, PRs) using Chart.js
- Add import/export, search, filters, and CSV/JSON backup
- Add unit tests for core components

Tell me which features you want next and I will implement them.
